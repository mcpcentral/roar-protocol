# Layer 3: Connect

> Transport negotiation, session management, keep-alive, connection lifecycle

---

## Overview

The Connect layer handles how agents establish and maintain connections. ROAR supports multiple transport protocols and auto-selects the best one based on context.

The Connect layer provides:
- **Transport negotiation** — auto-select stdio, HTTP, WebSocket, or gRPC
- **Session management** — persistent sessions with keep-alive
- **Connection lifecycle** — connect, heartbeat, disconnect, reconnect
- **Authentication** — HMAC, JWT, mTLS, or open

## Transport Types

| Transport | When to use | Latency | Bidirectional |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------------|
| `stdio` | Claude Code terminals, MCP servers | Lowest | Yes (via stdio) |
| `http` | REST APIs, HTTP bridge, cross-machine | Low | No (request/response) |
| `websocket` | Real-time dashboards, streaming | Low | Yes |
| `grpc` | High-throughput, binary serialization | Lowest | Yes |

### Auto-Selection Rules

```
MCP context (Claude Code)     → stdio
PROWLR_HUB_URL is set         → http (via bridge)
Dashboard/console connected    → websocket
High-throughput batch          → grpc
```

## Wire Format

### ConnectionConfig

```json
{
  "transport": "http",
  "url": "http://192.168.1.100:8099",
  "auth_method": "hmac",
  "secret": "shared-secret-key",
  "timeout_ms": 30000
}
```

## Connection Lifecycle

### 1. Connect

```
Agent                          Hub/Server
  │                                │
  ├── Register (name, caps) ──────→│
  │                                ├── Create agent entry
  │                                ├── Assign agent_id
  │←── agent_id, room_id ─────────┤
  │                                │
```

### 2. Heartbeat

Agents send heartbeats every 60 seconds. If no heartbeat is received for 5 minutes, the agent is considered dead and its locks are released.

### 3. Dead Agent Sweep

The hub periodically sweeps for dead agents:
- Finds agents with `last_heartbeat` > 5 minutes ago
- Releases all their file locks
- Returns their tasks to "pending"
- Marks agents as "disconnected"

### 4. Graceful Disconnect

On disconnect, all resources are cleaned up immediately without waiting for the sweep.

## Authentication Methods

| Method | How it works | Best for |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `hmac` | HMAC-SHA256 signature on message body | Default, shared-secret environments |
| `jwt` | JWT bearer token in auth header | Web APIs, multi-tenant |
| `mtls` | Mutual TLS certificates | Production, zero-trust |
| `none` | No authentication | Local development, same-machine |

## ProwlrHub Connection Modes

### Local Mode (stdio → SQLite)

```
Claude Code Terminal → MCP stdio → ProwlrHub MCP Server → SQLite WAL
```

No network, no bridge. All terminals on the same machine share one SQLite file.

### Remote Mode (stdio → HTTP → SQLite)

```
Claude Code Terminal → MCP stdio → ProwlrHub MCP Server
    → Detects PROWLR_HUB_URL → HTTP Bridge Client (urllib)
    → HTTP Bridge Server (FastAPI :8099) → SQLite WAL
```

The MCP server auto-detects `PROWLR_HUB_URL` and routes all operations through the HTTP bridge.
